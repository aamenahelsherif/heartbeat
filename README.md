## Cardiovascular Disease Prevalence 
A project exploring how certain health indicators and lifestyle factors can predict cardiovascular disease prevalence. Particularly, what combination of factors result in the highest risk of cardiovascular disease prevalence in males vs females.
#### Main Findings: 
Ages 50+ and Hypertension Stage 2 are most highly associated, regardless of gender.\
Above Normal Cholesterol and Physical Activity tend to represent a higher risk factor males more than females.\
Well Above Normal Cholesterol and Hypertension Stage 1 tend to represent a higher risk factor for females than males.
#### Conclusions: 
More research is required, however the findings are interesting in helping pinpoint what factors should be tested first, in order to minimize patient wait times and maximise healthcare facility efficiency.
