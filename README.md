## 🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Prevalence 🫀 
In healthcare we know not all symptoms or risks are created equal, and cardiovascular disease is no exception.
What major differences can we find in risk factors between genders? And can there be differences based on which _combination_ of risk factors a patient has? This is what I explored in this project.

### Main Findings: 
Based on the data, I created a system called a "Red Flag Order" for each gender. Essentially a healthcare provider could look at this and know what to look for first, depending on the patient's gender. 

#### In both Males and Females🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️: 
👴👵 **Ages 50+** and 📈 **Hypertension Stage 2** are most highly associated with cardiovascular disease. These are the biggest 🚩, regardless of gender. Check for these first!

#### Red Flag Order In Males 🧍‍♂️: 
1: 🍔 **Well Above Normal Cholesterol** combined with Normal or Hypertension Stage 1 Blood Pressure\
2: 🍔 **Above Normal Cholesterol** combined with Hypertension Stage 1\
3: 🏃‍♂️ **Lack of Physical Activity**\

#### Red Flag Order In Females 🧍‍♀️: 
1: 🍔 **Well Above Normal Cholesterol**\

2: 📈 **Hypertension Stage 1**


### Conclusions: 
More research is required, however the findings are interesting in helping pinpoint what factors should be tested first, in order to minimize patient wait times and maximise healthcare facility efficiency.
